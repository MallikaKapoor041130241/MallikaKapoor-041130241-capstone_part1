# Quiz App Project

## Project Overview
This project is a web-based Quiz App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to select a quiz category and difficulty level and take a quiz. The app fetches quiz questions from an API and provides an interactive interface for users to answer the questions and track their performance.

## Challenges Faced

### 1. API Integration
- **Challenge**: Fetching questions dynamically and managing API errors.
- **Solution**: Utilized asynchronous JavaScript (`async/await`) for seamless API calls and added error handling to ensure the app remains functional even if the API fails.

### 2. Responsive Design
- **Challenge**: Ensuring the app is usable and visually appealing on all devices.
- **Solution**: Used flexbox and responsive CSS units to create a scalable layout adaptable to various screen sizes.

### 3. Data Persistence
- **Challenge**: Retaining user stats across browser sessions.
- **Solution**: Implemented local storage to save and retrieve user performance data, ensuring stats persist even after a page reload.

### 4. User Experience
- **Challenge**: Designing an intuitive and engaging interface.
- **Solution**: Incorporated dynamic styles and interactive elements, like hover effects and animations, to enhance usability and engagement.

## Future Enhancements
- **Add More Categories**: Include additional quiz categories for broader user engagement.
- **Timer Feature**: Implement a countdown timer for each question to increase challenge.
- **Leaderboard**: Add a feature to display user scores on a global leaderboard.
- **User Authentication**: Allow users to save and retrieve stats across devices through login.
